# eslint-config-axonteam
This is the global eslint config for all Axonteam javascript projects.  
This configuration is not meant to be permissive, however, it aims to be fairly strict to guarantee consistent code style.  

All team projects should be using this configuration, however, everyone is welcome to use it.  

## Installations
This package is availabe on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axonteam/eslint-config-axonteam).  
Install this package with `npm install @axonteam/eslint-config-axonteam` or `yarn add @axonteam/eslint-config-axonteam`.  
Make sure to have eslint already installed in your project.  
Now simply create a `.eslintrc.json` file and add the following: `"extends": "@axonteam"` or eventually `"extends": "@axonteam/eslint-config-axonteam"`.
